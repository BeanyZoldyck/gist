Before: – 22 years old – $100k in debt – Skinny-fat – Hacker house

After: – 25 years old – $350k in debt – Just fat – Homeless

Here’s what I did after:

Content: IT Unprofessional (@it_unprofession) My wife just asked me if I'm "done working" because her sister wants to FaceTime. I said, "Yeah, the upgrade finished. Everything's stable now." 

I haven't looked at a single work system all day. I've been playing Elden Ring for 4 hours. 

But I made sure to leave my laptop open

Content: Marmik Patel (@Marmik_Patel19) applying to jobs is the dumbest shit you can ever do. i learned the hard way. dmed a 1000 recruiters/engineers. did 670 apps. didn't get me anything. cause its not equally distributed: the top 10% of people take 90% of the jobs. 

it's the same everywhere else. the hottest girl gets 90% of the guys. the largest artist gets 90% of the streams. so this past year i stopped wasting time on applying and started doing whatever gave me the biggest impact. did hella trips to sf/nyc, built products, did content, made friends. 

and soon the dynamic flipped. jan-may, 83 recruiters dmed me. ai labs, yc companies, unicorns. 

it's a winner-takes-all world. you have no choice but to become the winner. or waste away your life fighting for scraps.

Content: rasmalai (@rasmalai) there’s an insane amount of MONEY hiding where most people don’t look. • take any reddit thread and add /.json to the url • you get the full conversation instantly • every reply, deep threads included • all the context and metadata in a clean format 

now do something smart with it: • pass it through an llm • map real user pain • spot intent, not guesses • find patterns no one reads manually

small subreddits are gold mines. people openly explain what they need and what they’d pay for. 

the advantage isn’t speed. it’s listening better than everyone else.

he found the glitch:

plumbers hate everything except fixing pipes

they hate quoting, scheduling, invoicing, and the endless back-and-forth with customers

he built a system that automates the entire mess:
